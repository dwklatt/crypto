FOLLOWING ITEMS BY EMAIL BEFORE
THE MIDDLE OF NEXT MONTH 

FIRST DESCRIBE THE SUBSTITUTION TABLE
USED FOR THE LETTERS PRESENT IN THE PLAIN TEXT
"A" -> "P"  
"B" -> "C"      
"D" -> "D"      
"E" -> "L"  
"G" -> "W"  
"H" -> "N"  
"I" -> "K"  
"J" -> "B"  
"K" -> "V"  
"L" -> "H"  
"M" -> "X"  
"O" -> "I"  
"P" -> "F"  
"Q" -> "M"  
"R" -> "R"  
"S" -> "E"  
"T" -> "Y"  
"U" -> "T"  
"V" -> "G"  
"W" -> "O"  
"X" -> "A"  
"Y" -> "S"  
"Z" -> "U"

SECOND DESCRIBE CAREFULLY HOW YOU BREAK THE CIPHER

You break the cipher by replacing letters until english words or what looks like englih starts to form and then add in the rest of the letters
to complete the words.  At the start replacing the three most common letters with e,t and a also help get decryption started.  In this specific
case knowing that the due date was also encrypted in the message helped because a large chunk of letter kept reappearing and it could be guessed that
it was the word assignment encrypted.

THIRD DESCRIBE AND IMPLEMENT
YOUR OWN CIPHER SYSTEM FOR
ENCRYPTING AND DECRYPTING TEXT FILES
YOU MAY USE ANY PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
OF YOUR CHOICE ALSO INCLUDE A BRIEF
DISCUSSION COMPARING THE RELATIVE
SECURITY OF YOUR CIPHER TO THE
MONOALPHABETIC SUBSTITUTION CIPHER
USED FOR THE TEXT OF THIS ASSIGNMENT
AS PART OF THE SUBMISSION FOR THE
THIRD PART PROVIDE A LIVE
DEMONSTRATION OF YOUR SYSTEM 

Mine is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher with random letters added and takes into account for capital letters.  This makes is much harder to crack by hand because it increases the possibilities of what each letter could be and adds more distractions with the random letters added.  The increase of possibilities isn't larger enough to make a comparable difference for the speed computers could crack it.
